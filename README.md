# GermanTrafficSignDetection
Deep learning algorithm that simultaneously localizes and identifies German Traffic Signs.

The algorithm is an adaptation of [Fastai's](https://www.fast.ai) [Lesson 9](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/courses/dl2/pascal-multi.ipynb) to the problem of Traffic Sign Detection (i.e. bounding box regression + identification) on the  [German Traffic Sign Detection dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsdb&subsection=news)
